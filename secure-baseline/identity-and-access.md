# Identity & Access Baseline

## Principles
- Least privilege access (AC-6)
- No shared or static credentials
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Separation of duties

## Implementation
- All services and users use managed identities
- Access permissions are explicitly granted and regularly reviewed
- MFA required for all administrative accounts
- Default access is denied; explicit grants required
