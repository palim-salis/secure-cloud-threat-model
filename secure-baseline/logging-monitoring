# Logging & Monitoring Baseline

## Principles
- All security-relevant events must be logged (AU-2)
- Logs must be immutable
- Alerts for suspicious activity

## Implementation
- Centralized logging platform
- Audit logs for authentication, access, and configuration changes
- Immutable log storage to prevent tampering
- Alerts configured for high-risk events (e.g., failed login attempts, privilege changes)
- Retention and rotation policy in line with compliance requirements
