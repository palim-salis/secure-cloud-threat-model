# secure-cloud-threat-model
Threat modeling and NIST SP 800-53 control mapping for a secure-by-default cloud application.
# Secure Cloud Threat Modeling Project

This project demonstrates structured threat modeling and security control
implementation aligned with NIST SP 800-53.

The scope includes identifying security risks early in the development lifecycle,
mapping mitigations to selected NIST controls, and documenting secure-by-default
engineering practices for a cloud-based application.

Frameworks & Concepts:
- STRIDE Threat Modeling
- NIST SP 800-53 (AC-6, AU-2, SC-8, SC-28)
- Secure-by-Default Architecture
- Security Automation
